# ðŸŽ¯ Instructions for Earning Exercise Points

## **1. Attendance and Punctuality**

- Arrive **on time** for lectures.
- Usually in your calendar lecture is marked to start at 9.00 or 12.30. Our
  lectures start at 8.45 and 12.15 (15 minutes earlier) despite of the calendar.
- **Within the first 15 minutes** of the lecture (for example 8.45-9.00):
  - Mark your physical presence in the provided **Google Sheet**.
  - **Important:** Only mark yourself present if you are physically in class.
- After **15 minutes**, for example at 9.00, the **Google Sheet will be locked**, and attendance cannot be marked.
- **Latecomers** will not be able to register their attendance. For example, if you come
  to class at 9.01, you are 16 minutes late and not entitled to points.
- **Push exercises** to **GitHub** before the deadline.
